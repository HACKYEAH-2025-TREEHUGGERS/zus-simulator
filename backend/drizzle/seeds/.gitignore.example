# Database Seed Files (.gitignore suggestions)
# 
# You may want to add these patterns to your .gitignore if you want to:
# - Keep some seed files private (e.g., production data dumps)
# - Ignore temporary/local seed files
#
# Example patterns:
# backend/drizzle/seeds/*_local.sql
# backend/drizzle/seeds/*_temp.sql
# backend/drizzle/seeds/private_*.sql
